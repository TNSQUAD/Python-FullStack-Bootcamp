Lesson 3: JavaScript Basics (6 hours)

Overview:
In this lesson, we will introduce JavaScript, a versatile programming language that adds interactivity and dynamic functionality to web pages. We'll cover the fundamentals of JavaScript, including variables, data types, operators, control flow, functions, and objects. We'll also explore how to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) to interact with HTML elements and handle events.

Topics Covered:
1. Introduction to JavaScript
   - What is JavaScript?
   - JavaScript in web development
   - JavaScript frameworks and libraries

2. JavaScript Basics
   - Variables and data types
   - Operators and expressions
   - Control flow (conditional statements and loops)
   - Functions and scope

3. JavaScript and the DOM
   - Introduction to the Document Object Model (DOM)
   - Accessing and modifying HTML elements with JavaScript
   - Handling events and event listeners

4. Arrays and Objects
   - Working with arrays (creation, manipulation, iteration)
   - Introduction to objects (properties and methods)

5. Error Handling and Debugging
   - Common JavaScript errors and debugging techniques
   - Using browser developer tools for debugging

6. Asynchronous JavaScript and AJAX
   - Introduction to asynchronous programming
   - AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) for data retrieval

Lesson Objectives:
- Understand the role of JavaScript in web development.
- Learn the basics of JavaScript, including variables, operators, control flow, functions, and objects.
- Manipulate the DOM using JavaScript to create dynamic and interactive web pages.
- Handle events and utilize event listeners to respond to user interactions.
- Explore error handling and debugging techniques in JavaScript.
- Gain an introduction to asynchronous programming and AJAX.

   - Common JavaScript errors
   - Debugging techniques and tools (browser developer tools)

6. Asynchronous JavaScript and AJAX (60 minutes)
   - Introduction to asynchronous programming
   - AJAX for data retrieval and updating web pages

7. Conclusion and Recap (15 minutes)
   - Summary of key concepts covered in the lesson
   - Preview of the next lesson on Introduction to Backend Development with Flask

Hands-on Exercise:
Create a JavaScript function that calculates and displays the area of a rectangle based on user input. Use prompt dialogs to get the necessary input from the user and alert to display the result.

Coding Challenge:
Build a simple interactive game using JavaScript. The game can be a quiz, a puzzle, or any other interactive concept you prefer. Implement logic for user input, scoring, and feedback.

Project Assignment:
Create a dynamic web page that allows users to add and remove items from a shopping cart. Use JavaScript to update the cart total and display the selected items. Implement basic validation to prevent invalid inputs.

Summary:
In this lesson, we explored the basics of JavaScript and its role in web development. We learned about variables, data types, control flow, functions, and objects in JavaScript. We also delved into manipulating the DOM, handling events, and using JavaScript for asynchronous operations. In the next lesson,

 we will dive into backend development with Flask, a Python web framework. Get ready to explore server-side programming!
