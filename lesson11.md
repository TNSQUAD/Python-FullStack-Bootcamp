Lesson 11: Project 1 - Personal Blog (20 hours)

Overview:
In this lesson, you will work on your first full-stack project, which is to build a personal blog website. This project will allow you to apply the knowledge and skills you have learned so far in a practical way. You will design and implement the frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and develop the backend using Django. By the end of this project, you will have a fully functional blog website where you can create, read, update, and delete blog posts.

Project Objectives:
- Design and implement the frontend of a personal blog website.
- Develop the backend using Django to handle blog post creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion.
- Incorporate user authentication and authorization for managing blog posts.
- Create a responsive and visually appealing user interface for the blog website.
- Apply best practices in code organization, project structure, and documentation.

Project Requirements:
1. Frontend Development:
   - Design and implement the user interface using HTML and CSS.
   - Apply responsive design techniques to ensure the website looks good on different devices.
   - Use JavaScript to add interactivity and dynamic elements to the blog website.

2. Backend Development:
   - Set up a Django project and create the necessary models for blog posts.
   - Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for blog posts.
   - Create views and templates for displaying blog posts and individual blog post pages.
   - Implement user authentication and authorization to allow only authorized users to create, update, and delete blog posts.

3. Database Integration:
   - Configure and connect Django to a database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL).
   - Define database models for blog posts and other necessary entities.
   - Use Django's ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) to interact with the database.

4. User Experience and Design:
   - Ensure a smooth and intuitive user experience when navigating the blog website.
   - Implement features such as pagination, search functionality, and tags for organizing blog posts.
   - Apply CSS styling to create an aesthetically pleasing and visually appealing design.

5. Testing and Validation:
   - Write unit tests to ensure the functionality of key components.
   - Validate user inputs and handle edge cases to prevent errors or unexpected behavior.
   - Conduct manual testing to ensure the blog website works as expected.

6. Deployment:
   - Deploy the blog website to a hosting platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS) to make it accessible online.
   - Set up necessary configurations and environment variables for the production deployment.

1. Project Setup and Frontend Design (4 hours)
2. Backend Development and Database Integration (6 hours)
3. User Authentication and Authorization (4 hours)
4. User Experience Enhancement (3 hours)
5. Testing and Validation (2 hours)
