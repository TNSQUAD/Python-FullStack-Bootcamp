Lesson 19: Project 9 - Weather Application (25 hours)

Overview:
In this lesson, you will build a Weather Application that provides real-time weather information for various locations. The project involves developing a web application that allows users to search for a specific location and retrieve weather data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and forecast. You will learn how to integrate weather APIs, handle API responses, and display weather data in a user-friendly manner. By completing this project, you will gain experience in working with external APIs, handling data, and creating interactive web applications.

Project Objectives:
- Develop a Weather Application that fetches and displays real-time weather information.
- Implement location search functionality to retrieve weather data for specific locations.
- Display weather data in a user-friendly and visually appealing manner.
- Enhance the application with features like weather forecasts and temperature conversion.

Project Requirements:
1. User Interface and Design:
   - Design a visually appealing user interface for the weather application.
   - Create a layout that displays weather information clearly and intuitively.
   - Implement responsive design to ensure a seamless user experience across different devices.

2. Location Search and Auto-suggestion:
   - Allow users to search for a specific location to retrieve weather data.
   - Implement auto-suggestion functionality to help users find accurate location results.
   - Handle location selection and initiate weather data fetching based on the chosen location.

3. Weather Data Integration:
   - Integrate with a weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, Weatherbit) to fetch real-time weather data.
   - Retrieve weather information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and description.

4. Displaying Weather Information:
   - Present the fetched weather data in a user-friendly format.
   - Display the current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and icon representation.
   - Provide additional information like sunrise and sunset times, visibility, and atmospheric pressure.

5. Weather Forecast:
   - Extend the application to provide weather forecasts for upcoming days.
   - Display forecasted temperature, weather conditions, and relevant icons for each day.
   - Allow users to navigate between different forecasted days.

6. Temperature Conversion:
   - Implement the option for users to switch between different temperature units (e.g., Celsius, Fahrenheit).
   - Convert and display the temperature values based on the user's selected unit.

7. Error Handling and Feedback:
   - Handle potential errors or invalid API responses.
   - Provide meaningful feedback to users in case of errors or failures in retrieving weather data.
   - Display appropriate messages or alerts for unsuccessful API requests.

8. Geolocation:
   - Add the option to retrieve weather data based on the user's current geolocation.
   - Implement geolocation functionality to automatically detect the user's location.

9. User Preferences:
   - Allow users to save their preferred locations and access weather information quickly.
   - Provide options for managing saved locations, such as adding, removing, or editing them.

10. Testing and Optimization:
    - Conduct thorough testing to ensure the functionality and accuracy of the weather application.
    - Optimize API requests and response handling for improved performance.
    - Write unit tests to validate critical components, such as weather data retrieval and display.
