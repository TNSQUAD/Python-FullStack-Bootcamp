Lesson 12: Project 2 - E-commerce Website (30 hours)

Overview:
In this lesson, you will embark on a more complex project to build an e-commerce website. The project will involve both frontend and backend development, database management, and integration with payment gateways. You will have the opportunity to create a fully functional online store where users can browse products, add items to their cart, place orders, and make payments. By the end of this project, you will have a solid understanding of building dynamic and transactional web applications.

Project Objectives:
- Design and implement the frontend of an e-commerce website.
- Develop the backend using Django to handle product listings, cart management, and order processing.
- Integrate with a payment gateway for secure online transactions.
- Implement user authentication and authorization for managing orders and user profiles.
- Apply best practices in code organization, project structure, and documentation.

Project Requirements:
1. Frontend Development:
   - Design and implement the user interface for the e-commerce website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
   - Create pages for product listings, individual product details, shopping cart, and order placement.
   - Implement responsive design techniques to ensure the website is mobile-friendly.

2. Backend Development:
   - Set up a Django project and create models for products, orders, and user profiles.
   - Implement CRUD functionality for managing products, orders, and user profiles.
   - Create views and templates for displaying product listings, individual product details, and user orders.
   - Implement user authentication and authorization to allow only authorized users to place orders.

3. Database Integration:
   - Configure and connect Django to a database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL) to store product and order data.
   - Define database models for products, orders, and user profiles.
   - Use Django's ORM to interact with the database.

4. Cart Management and Order Processing:
   - Implement functionality for adding products to the cart, updating quantities, and removing items.
   - Develop the order placement process, including address input, order summary, and payment selection.
   - Integrate with a payment gateway (e.g., Stripe) to handle secure online transactions.

5. User Experience and Design:
   - Enhance the user experience by implementing features such as product search, filtering, and sorting.
   - Implement a user-friendly and intuitive interface for managing the shopping cart and placing orders.
   - Apply CSS styling to create an appealing design consistent with e-commerce best practices.

6. Testing and Validation:
   - Write unit tests to ensure the functionality of critical components, such as cart management and order processing.
   - Conduct thorough testing to validate the user experience and identify and fix any bugs or issues.

7. Deployment:
   - Deploy the e-commerce website to a hosting platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS) to make it accessible online.
   - Configure necessary settings and environment variables for the production deployment.

Project Milestones:
1. Project Setup and Frontend Design (6 hours)
2. Backend Development and Database Integration (8 hours)
3. Cart Management and Order Processing (6 hours)
4. User Authentication and Authorization (4 hours)
5. User Experience Enhancement (3 hours)
6. Testing and Validation (2 hours)
7. Deployment (1 hour)

Estimated Completion Time: 30 hours
