Lesson 13: Project 3 - Social Media Platform (35 hours)

Overview:
In this lesson, you will undertake the development of a social media platform. This project will involve building a comprehensive web application that allows users to create profiles, connect with friends, share posts, and engage in social interactions. You will gain hands-on experience with advanced backend development techniques, database management, user authentication, and real-time communication. By the end of this project, you will have a solid understanding of building complex social media applications.

Project Objectives:
- Design and implement a user-friendly and interactive social media platform.
- Develop the backend using Django to handle user profiles, post creation, and social interactions.
- Implement user authentication and authorization for secure access to features and data.
- Integrate real-time communication features using technologies such as WebSockets or AJAX.
- Apply best practices in code organization, project structure, and documentation.

Project Requirements:
1. User Profile Management:
   - Implement user registration and login functionality.
   - Allow users to create and edit their profiles with personal information and profile pictures.
   - Provide options for users to manage their privacy settings and account preferences.

2. Post Creation and Interaction:
   - Enable users to create, edit, and delete posts.
   - Implement features for liking, commenting on, and sharing posts.
   - Display post feeds based on user connections and interests.

3. Friend Connections:
   - Enable users to send and accept friend requests.
   - Implement a friend suggestion feature based on common interests or connections.
   - Allow users to view their friend list and manage their connections.

4. Real-Time Communication:
   - Integrate real-time messaging or chat functionality using technologies like WebSockets or AJAX.
   - Enable users to send direct messages to their friends.
   - Implement real-time notifications for friend requests, post interactions, and messages.

5. Privacy and Security:
   - Implement user authentication and authorization to protect sensitive features and data.
   - Develop privacy settings to allow users to control who can view their posts and profile information.
   - Apply security measures to prevent common vulnerabilities, such as cross-site scripting (XSS) and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).

6. User Experience and Design:
   - Create an intuitive and visually appealing user interface for profile management, post creation, and social interactions.
   - Implement features to enhance the user experience, such as search functionality, filters, and personalized feeds.
   - Apply responsive design techniques to ensure the platform is accessible and optimized for different devices.

7. Testing and Validation:
   - Write comprehensive unit tests to validate the functionality of critical components, such as user authentication and post interactions.
   - Conduct thorough testing to ensure a smooth user experience and identify and fix any bugs or issues.

8. Deployment:
   - Deploy the social media platform to a hosting platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS) to make it accessible online.
   - Configure necessary settings and environment variables for the production deployment.
