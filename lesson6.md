   - Utilizing tools like Swagger or Postman for API documentation

7. Testing and Debugging APIs (60 minutes)
   - Writing unit tests for API endpoints to ensure their functionality
   - Debugging common API issues and error handling
   - Using tools like Post

man or cURL for API testing and troubleshooting

Hands-On Exercises:
1. Create a Flask application with two routes: `/api/users` and `/api/posts`. Return dummy data for each route.
2. Implement different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for the `/api/users` route.
3. Add request validation to the `/api/posts` route to ensure required fields are present in the request payload.
4. Implement user authentication for the `/api/users` route using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
5. Serialize data from a database query to JSON format and return it as an API response.
6. Deserialize JSON data received from a POST request to create a new record in the database.

Coding Challenges:
1. Write a Flask route that accepts a dynamic parameter and returns the corresponding record from a database.
2. Implement an API endpoint that allows users to update their profile information using a PUT request.
3. Add pagination support to an API endpoint that returns a list of items.
4. Create a Flask route that accepts query parameters and filters database records based on those parameters.
5. Implement rate limiting on an API endpoint to prevent abuse or excessive requests.

Project Assignment:
Build a RESTful API for a blogging platform. The API should support the following functionalities:
- User registration and authentication using JWT.
- CRUD operations for blog posts, including creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting posts.
- User authorization to ensure that only the author of a post can modify or delete it.
- Commenting functionality for blog posts.
- Pagination and filtering options for retrieving a list of posts.
- Implement proper error handling and response formatting.

Lesson 6: Building RESTful APIs with Django (8 hours)

Overview:
In this lesson, we will explore how to build RESTful APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) using Django. RESTful APIs allow applications to communicate and exchange data in a standardized and scalable manner. We will learn how to design API endpoints, handle HTTP requests and responses, and implement authentication and authorization for secure API access. By the end of this lesson, you will have the skills to create robust and flexible APIs using Django.

Topics Covered:
1. Introduction to RESTful APIs
   - Understanding the principles of REST architecture
   - Exploring the benefits of building APIs

2. Designing API Endpoints
   - Defining resource endpoints and their HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
   - Structuring URL patterns for API endpoints

3. Handling HTTP Requests and Responses
   - Parsing request data and extracting parameters
   - Serializing data for response

4. Serializers and Deserializers
   - Using Django serializers to convert model instances to JSON and vice versa
   - Customizing serializers for complex data structures

5. Authentication and Authorization in APIs
   - Implementing token-based authentication using Django's authentication framework
   - Restricting API access using permission classes
