Lesson 14: Project 4 - Task Management App (25 hours)

Overview:
In this lesson, you will work on building a task management application. The project involves creating a web application that allows users to create, organize, and track tasks and to-do lists. You will gain hands-on experience in frontend and backend development, database management, user authentication, and data manipulation. By the end of this project, you will have a solid understanding of building efficient task management applications.

Project Objectives:
- Design and implement a user-friendly task management application.
- Develop both the frontend and backend components of the application.
- Implement user authentication and authorization for secure access to tasks.
- Create a database schema to store and retrieve task data.
- Provide features for task creation, organization, and tracking.
- Apply best practices in code structure, user interface design, and documentation.

Project Requirements:
1. User Authentication:
   - Implement user registration and login functionality.
   - Allow users to manage their profiles and account settings.

2. Task Management:
   - Enable users to create, edit, and delete tasks.
   - Implement features for task categorization, priority setting, and due dates.
   - Provide options for marking tasks as completed and tracking progress.

3. Task Organization:
   - Implement task lists or projects to help users organize their tasks.
   - Enable users to create, edit, and delete task lists.
   - Implement features for categorizing tasks within lists and reordering tasks.

4. User Collaboration:
   - Allow users to share tasks or task lists with other users.
   - Implement features for assigning tasks to specific users.
   - Enable users to collaborate and communicate on shared tasks.

5. Notifications and Reminders:
   - Implement notifications and reminders for upcoming or overdue tasks.

6. User Interface Design:
   - Create an intuitive and visually appealing user interface for task management.
   - Implement features to enhance the user experience, such as search functionality, filters, and sorting options.
   - Apply responsive design techniques to ensure the application is accessible and optimized for different devices.

7. Data Persistence:
   - Design and implement a database schema to store and retrieve task data.
   - Utilize appropriate database queries and operations for efficient data manipulation.

8. Testing and Validation:
   - Write comprehensive unit tests to validate the functionality of critical components, such as task creation and task updates.
   - Conduct thorough testing to ensure a smooth user experience and identify and fix any bugs or issues.

9. Deployment:
   - Deploy the task management application to a hosting platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS) to make it accessible online.
   - Configure necessary settings and environment variables for the production deployment.
