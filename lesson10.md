Lesson 10: Deployment and DevOps (6 hours)

Overview:
In this lesson, we will focus on the deployment and DevOps aspects of full-stack development. Deploying a web application involves various steps, including server setup, configuration, and deployment automation. We will explore different deployment options and tools, such as cloud platforms, containerization, and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. Additionally, we will discuss best practices for monitoring and managing deployed applications to ensure their availability and performance.

Topics Covered:
1. Introduction to Deployment and DevOps
   - Understanding the importance of deployment and DevOps in the software development lifecycle
   - Exploring the benefits of automated deployment and continuous integration

2. Server Environment Setup
   - Selecting and setting up a server environment for deploying web applications
   - Configuring server software, such as Apache or Nginx, for hosting web applications
   - Securing the server environment and implementing necessary security measures

3. Cloud Deployment with Platform as a Service (PaaS)
   - Exploring cloud platforms like Heroku or AWS Elastic Beanstalk for easy application deployment
   - Deploying web applications using PaaS platforms and configuring necessary settings
   - Scaling and managing applications in a cloud environment

4. Containerization with Docker
   - Introduction to containerization and Docker
   - Building Docker images for web applications and configuring container settings
   - Deploying Docker containers to host applications and managing containerized environments

5. Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
   - Understanding the CI/CD process and its benefits for streamlining application deployment
   - Setting up CI/CD pipelines with tools like Jenkins or GitLab CI/CD
   - Automating the deployment process with version control and automated testing

6. Monitoring and Performance Optimization
   - Implementing monitoring solutions to track application performance and availability
   - Using tools like Prometheus or New Relic for application monitoring
   - Analyzing performance metrics and optimizing application resources

Lesson Objectives:

Hands-on Exercise:
1. Set up a server environment for hosting a web application using Apache or Nginx.
2. Deploy a sample web application on a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS Elastic Beanstalk).
3. Containerize a web application using Docker and deploy it in a container environment.
4. Configure a CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment using Jenkins or GitLab CI/CD.
5. Implement monitoring for a deployed application using Prometheus or New Relic.

Coding Challenges:
1. Write a script to automate the server environment setup and software configuration process.
2. Create a Dockerfile for containerizing a web application and test the deployment.
3. Configure a Jenkins or GitLab CI/CD pipeline to automate the deployment of a web application.
4. Implement custom monitoring and alerting using Prometheus or New Relic.
