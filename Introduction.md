Recommended Prerequisites and Tools:
While this course is designed for beginners, some prior programming experience will be helpful. Familiarity with basic programming concepts like variables, functions, and control flow will ease your learning process. Additionally, having a basic understanding of web technologies such as HTML and CSS can be advantageous.

To follow along with the lessons and complete the projects, you will need the following tools:

1. Python: Install the latest version of Python, which can be downloaded from the official Python website (python.org). We recommend using Python 3.x.

2. Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Choose a Python-friendly IDE for coding, such as Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, or Atom. These IDEs provide a robust development environment with helpful features like code completion and debugging tools.

3. Web Browser: Use a modern web browser like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Microsoft Edge for testing and viewing web applications.

4. Command Line Interface (CLI): Familiarize yourself with the command line interface for executing commands and managing your development environment. On Windows, you can use the Command Prompt or PowerShell, while macOS and Linux users can use the Terminal.

Throughout this textbook, we will guide you in setting up your development environment and provide instructions specific to the tools and technologies used in each lesson.

Now that you have a clear understanding of how to use this textbook and the prerequisites required, let's dive into the exciting world of full-stack development with Python!

In the next lesson, we will introduce the fundamental concepts of full-stack development and explore the basics of HTML and CSS. Get ready to embark on an interactive learning journey that will equip you with the skills to create dynamic web applications.
