Lesson 24: Project 14 - Fitness Tracker (25 hours)

Overview:
In this lesson, you will build a Fitness Tracker web application that allows users to track their fitness activities and progress. The project will involve designing a user-friendly interface, implementing features for creating and managing workout routines, tracking exercises and sets, calculating statistics, and providing visualizations of fitness data. By working on this project, you will gain experience in building data-driven applications, handling user input and data manipulation, and presenting meaningful insights to users.

Project Objectives:
- Develop a Fitness Tracker application that allows users to track their workouts and progress.
- Implement features for creating and managing workout routines and exercises.
- Track exercise sets, repetitions, and weights to calculate performance statistics.
- Provide visualizations of fitness data to monitor progress and set goals.
- Implement user authentication and authorization to secure user data and access.

Project Requirements:
1. User Registration and Authentication:
   - Implement user registration, login, and logout functionality.
   - Allow users to create accounts and manage their profiles.
   - Secure user data and handle authentication.

2. Workout Routines:
   - Enable users to create and manage their workout routines.
   - Implement features like adding exercises, specifying sets, and rest intervals.
   - Allow users to customize their routines and view routine details.

3. Exercise Tracking:
   - Allow users to track their exercises and record sets, repetitions, and weights.
   - Implement features for adding exercises to workout routines and tracking progress.

4. Performance Statistics:
   - Calculate and display performance statistics for tracked exercises.
   - Provide insights such as total sets, total weight lifted, average repetitions, etc.
   - Show progress over time and allow users to compare their performance.

5. Goal Setting:
   - Enable users to set fitness goals and track their progress towards those goals.
   - Implement features for defining specific goals (e.g., weight loss, muscle gain) and tracking achievements.

6. Visualizations:
   - Provide visual representations of fitness data, such as charts or graphs.
   - Display progress over time, workout history, and goal achievements.
   - Allow users to customize and filter the visualizations based on their preferences.

7. Personal Records:
   - Implement a feature to track and display personal records for specific exercises.
   - Highlight the user's best performances in terms of weight lifted or repetitions achieved.

8. Workout Logging:
   - Allow users to log their completed workouts, including dates and durations.
   - Provide a history of past workouts for reference and analysis.

9. Progress Tracking:
   - Implement features to track overall progress in terms of strength, endurance, or other fitness metrics.
   - Allow users to track body measurements, weight, or other relevant data.

10. Mobile App Integration:
    - Optionally, integrate the fitness tracker with a mobile app for on-the-go tracking and convenience.
    - Allow users to synchronize their data between the web and mobile platforms.

11. Responsive Design:
    - Create a responsive and mobile-friendly design for optimal user experience on various devices.
    - Adapt the layout and functionality to different screen sizes and orientations.

12. Security and Privacy:
    - Implement appropriate security measures to protect user data and privacy.
    - Ensure secure authentication, authorization, and data handling practices.
