Lesson 4: Introduction to Backend Development with Django (8 hours)

Overview:
In this lesson, we will dive into backend development using Django, a powerful web framework written in Python. Django follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern and provides a robust set of tools and libraries for building scalable and feature-rich web applications. We will explore the core concepts of Django, including models, views, templates, URL routing, and database integration. By the end of this lesson, you will have a solid foundation in Django development and be able to create dynamic and interactive web applications.
