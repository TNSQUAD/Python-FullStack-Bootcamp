Lesson 15: Project 5 - Real-Time Chat Application (30 hours)

Overview:
In this lesson, you will dive into building a real-time chat application. The project involves creating a web-based chat application where users can engage in real-time conversations, send messages, and join different chat rooms. You will gain hands-on experience in implementing real-time communication using websockets, managing user sessions, and designing interactive user interfaces. By the end of this project, you will have a strong understanding of building real-time applications and handling live data exchanges.

Project Objectives:
- Develop a real-time chat application with multiple chat rooms.
- Implement the functionality to send and receive messages in real-time.
- Design an intuitive and interactive user interface for the chat application.
- Handle user authentication and session management.
- Enhance the user experience with features like typing indicators and message notifications.

Project Requirements:
1. User Authentication:
   - Implement user registration and login functionality.
   - Manage user sessions and authentication for accessing the chat application.

2. Chat Room Management:
   - Create multiple chat rooms that users can join and participate in.
   - Implement the functionality to create new chat rooms.
   - Allow users to join or leave chat rooms.

3. Real-Time Messaging:
   - Enable users to send and receive messages in real-time within chat rooms.
   - Implement the functionality to display messages as they are received by the server.
   - Handle message history and display previous messages when joining a chat room.

4. User Interface Design:
   - Design an intuitive and visually appealing user interface for the chat application.
   - Implement features to enhance the user experience, such as message formatting, emojis, and file attachments.
   - Display typing indicators to indicate when a user is typing a message.

5. User Presence and Notifications:
   - Show online/offline status of users in the chat application.
   - Implement notifications for new messages and updates in chat rooms.
   - Provide options for users to customize notification preferences.

6. Security and Privacy:
   - Implement measures to secure the chat application, such as validating and sanitizing user input.
   - Ensure that messages are only visible to users in the same chat room.
   - Implement privacy features, such as the ability to block or mute other users.

7. User Experience Enhancements:
   - Implement features like message search, message reactions, and message editing.
   - Provide options for users to customize their chat preferences, such as chat theme or font size.

8. Error Handling and Logging:
   - Implement error handling mechanisms to handle and display error messages to users.
   - Log application events and errors for troubleshooting and monitoring.

9. Testing and Validation:
   - Write comprehensive unit tests to validate the functionality of critical components, such as sending and receiving messages.
   - Conduct thorough testing to ensure a smooth real-time chat experience and identify and fix any bugs or issues.

10. Deployment:
    - Deploy the real-time chat application to a hosting platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS) to make it accessible online.
    - Configure necessary settings and environment variables for the production deployment.
