Lesson 28: Project 18 - Event Management System (30 hours)

Overview:
In this lesson, you will create an Event Management System that allows users to plan, organize, and manage events. The system will provide features for creating and managing event listings, handling event registrations, and facilitating communication between event organizers and attendees. By working on this project, you will gain experience in building applications with complex data models, implementing user roles and permissions, and integrating third-party services for enhanced functionality.

Project Objectives:
- Develop an Event Management System with event creation, registration, and communication features.
- Implement a user-friendly interface for event organizers and attendees.
- Incorporate features for event search, filtering, and recommendations.
- Integrate third-party services for location mapping and event reminders.

Project Requirements:
1. Event Creation and Management:
   - Allow users to create and manage event listings.
   - Provide fields for event details, such as title, description, date, time, location, and ticket pricing.
   - Implement features for updating and canceling events.

2. Event Registration:
   - Allow users to register for events and purchase tickets.
   - Provide options for different ticket types and quantities.
   - Handle payments securely and issue confirmation emails to attendees.

3. User Roles and Permissions:
   - Implement different user roles, such as event organizer and attendee.
   - Define permissions for each role, such as creating events, managing registrations, or viewing attendee lists.
   - Ensure proper authorization checks for different actions.

4. Event Search and Filtering:
   - Implement a search feature for users to find events based on keywords, location, or date.
   - Enable filtering options for event categories, price range, and popularity.
   - Display search results in a user-friendly manner.

5. Event Recommendations:
   - Provide personalized event recommendations based on user preferences and past activities.
   - Implement a recommendation engine to suggest relevant events to users.
   - Incorporate machine learning algorithms to improve the recommendation accuracy.

6. Communication and Notifications:
   - Facilitate communication between event organizers and attendees.
   - Implement features for sending event updates, reminders, and notifications.
   - Enable attendees to ask questions and receive responses from organizers.

7. Location Mapping and Directions:
   - Integrate a mapping service to display event locations on a map.
   - Enable users to get directions to event venues.
   - Provide additional information, such as nearby attractions or parking facilities.

8. Event Analytics and Reporting:
   - Implement analytics features to track event registrations, ticket sales, and attendee demographics.
   - Generate reports and insights for event organizers to evaluate event success and make informed decisions.

9. Responsive Design:
   - Create a responsive and mobile-friendly design for optimal user experience on various devices.
   - Adapt the layout and functionality to different screen sizes and orientations.

10. Security and Privacy:
    - Implement appropriate security measures to protect user data and privacy.
    - Ensure secure authentication, authorization, and data handling practices.

11. Performance Optimization:
    - Optimize the system for faster loading times and efficient resource utilization.
    - Implement caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data.
    - Minimize database queries and optimize code execution.
