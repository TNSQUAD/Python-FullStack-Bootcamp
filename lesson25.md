Lesson 25: Project 15 - Recipe Recommendation System (30 hours)

Overview:
In this lesson, you will build a Recipe Recommendation System, which suggests personalized recipes to users based on their preferences and dietary restrictions. The project will involve implementing algorithms for user profiling, recipe similarity analysis, and recommendation generation. By working on this project, you will gain experience in data analysis, machine learning, and building recommendation systems.

Project Objectives:
- Develop a Recipe Recommendation System that suggests recipes based on user preferences.
- Implement user profiling to understand individual tastes and dietary restrictions.
- Analyze recipe similarities and generate recommendations using machine learning techniques.
- Provide an intuitive user interface for exploring and discovering new recipes.

Project Requirements:
1. User Registration and Authentication:
   - Implement user registration, login, and logout functionality.
   - Allow users to create accounts and manage their profiles.
   - Secure user data and handle authentication.

2. User Preferences and Dietary Restrictions:
   - Enable users to set their preferences and dietary restrictions.
   - Collect information about preferred cuisines, ingredients, allergies, and dietary choices.

3. Recipe Database:
   - Build a database of recipes with attributes like ingredients, cooking instructions, and tags.
   - Include a variety of recipes from different cuisines and categories.

4. Recipe Similarity Analysis:
   - Implement algorithms to analyze recipe similarities based on ingredients, flavors, and other factors.
   - Determine similarity scores or distances between recipes.

5. Recommendation Generation:
   - Develop recommendation algorithms to generate personalized recipe suggestions.
   - Consider user preferences, dietary restrictions, and recipe similarities.
   - Use machine learning techniques such as collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or hybrid approaches.

6. Recipe Search and Exploration:
   - Implement a search functionality to allow users to find recipes by name, ingredient, or category.
   - Provide options for filtering and sorting the recipe results based on various criteria.

7. User Interface and User Experience:
   - Design an intuitive and user-friendly interface for browsing and discovering recipes.
   - Ensure smooth navigation, clear presentation of information, and easy interaction.

8. Recipe Details and Instructions:
   - Display detailed information about each recipe, including ingredients, cooking instructions, and nutritional facts.
   - Allow users to rate and leave comments on recipes they have tried.

9. Personalized Recommendations:
   - Present personalized recipe recommendations based on user preferences and past interactions.
   - Offer suggestions for similar recipes, new recipes, or recipes based on the user's history.

10. Social Sharing and Integration:
    - Optionally, include social sharing features for users to share their favorite recipes.
    - Integrate with external platforms like social media or email for easy recipe sharing.

11. Responsive Design:
    - Create a responsive and mobile-friendly design for optimal user experience on various devices.
    - Adapt the layout and functionality to different screen sizes and orientations.

12. Security and Privacy:
    - Implement appropriate security measures to protect user data and privacy.
    - Ensure secure authentication, authorization, and data handling practices.
